# Chess-Manager
Chess-Manager is an open source puzzle/tactic/positional generator for chess.

Most sites charge for use of their chess puzzles, however the goal of Chess-Manager
is to make an open source version.

Chess Manager will use stockfish and the lichessdatabase of games to generate positional puzzles.

# Languages and Technology
Python will be used in the backend to parse lichess database games, as well as interface with stockfish.
Python will also be used to train an AI-model for positional analysis.

React-JS will be used to construct a front-end for people to use the generated puzzles.
